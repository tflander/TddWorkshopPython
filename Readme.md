# TDD Workshop

Each folder in this repository is a self-contained kata for working out specific TDD concepts.
You can either do them in order from simple to complex, or skip to the concept that interests you.

## FizzBuzz
This kata is simplistic in order to focus on the Red/Green/Refactor cycle.

## RockPaperScissors
This is another simple kata to further practice Red/Green/Refactor.

## RomanNumerals
This kata focuses on using TDD to allow design to emerge, because the original problem is too big.

## Tennis Scoring
This kata is to practice code cleanup under test protection.  
The tests are complete, providing a safety net against introducing bugs.
